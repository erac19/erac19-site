I am a professor in the Vancouver School of Economics at UBC and an International Fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London.

My research interests centre around determinants of the wage and employment structure. In my recent work, this has entailed bridging between macro labour (worrying about general equilibrium effects) and micro labour identification issues.
